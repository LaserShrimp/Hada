# Hada, the simple level editor

## What is it ?
Hada, ("make/do" in Korean) is a level editor, initially made for the game Kill Their Balls, and aims to be a simple and adaptable level editor for video games.

## How does it works ?
Simply launch the executable, save your file as a .lvl file or load existing files, and modify it as you want :) Be aware that it contains json data.

## Is it a finished product ?
Certainly not: it's a little project I made to have a convenient tool for level editing and there are better level editors out there. Nevertheless, I have many ideas to make it better and more usable. Feel free to suggest modifications !

## How can I add my new levels made with Hada to my projects ?
Just save you level file where you want and then use the json data as you want.

### Some features I would like to add:
- a smoother interface, with toolbars and all.
- an editor to modify the properties of the current selected tile.
- an interface to add your own objects (they are now hardcoded and it's not easy to set up your own tiles, unless you directly change the code (which makes tools unusable for non programmers and inconvenient for programmers)).
- let the user the choice between several data formats.
- and so on...

## Can I contribute ?
Sure ! Just know that I'm NOT working on this project 100% of the time ;)
